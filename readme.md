Description:  
  Create a single page application showcasing your new online store! Feel free to use any framework / libraries
  that you are confident in. Or, if that's not your thing, vanilla JS will do as well ;). You will find the list
  of available items in the "store_items.json" file.
    * bonus points if you use React / Redux!  

Requirements:  
  1. Create the application based on the design, you can make changes that you think make more sense if necessary.  

  2. Display each item found in the "store_items.json" file. Each item should show the name, image, price,
    quantityRemaining (total number of each item remaining).  

  3. Create a shopping cart on the same page which lists the added items.  
    - the shopping card should include:
        1. names of items.
        2. price of item.
        3. total cost of all items in the cart.
        3. a way to remove the item from the cart.
        4. toggle to increase / decrease quantity (optional).
          - when increasing the quantity be sure to not go over the available quantity of each item!
        5. confirm purchase button that clears out the cart.
          - when confirming the purchase, update the quantity values in the list of items (optional).
